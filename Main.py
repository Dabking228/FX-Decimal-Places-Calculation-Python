#Problem Statement: To find out which method of handling the decimal places of the fx rates display. Round Up or Discard/Hide?
#Objective: To analyze which rate will achieve the closest value to the final settlement amount
#Exception Handling: Allow Â±0.01 discrepancy in displayed amounts and actual amounts

#Solution: Build a program to automatically insert payment amounts from different ranges then perform the necessary calculations
#          and export to CSV file
#          Accept user input: Selling currency, Buying currency, FXTS Rate (Raw rate)
